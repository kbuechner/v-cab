    <p>
        V-Cab was founded by four women with a dream:
        to provide high-quality, ethically-sourced blood to discerning consumers.
        In a market flooded by mass-produced and unregulated products,
        V-Cab was immediately successful.
        <br /><br />

        From its humble beginnings in a rental storage unit,
        equipped with only a handful of syringes,
        a collection of mason jars, and the founders' own veins,
        V-Cab has expanded across the Eastern Seaboard.
        With over three hundred employees, four distribution centers,
        and a wide variety of both local and imported sources,
        V-Cab has become the benchmark for excellence across all price points.
        Always fresh, never frozen,
        V-Cab is committed to providing new and exciting bloods
        as well as dependable and consistent standards.
